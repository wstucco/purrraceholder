Purrraceholder
=============

A simple clone of [placehold.it](http://placehold.it) powered by the mighty Grumpy cat  

This demo application was written as an introduction on writing web apps using the [Traffic framework](https://github.com/pilu/traffic),   
as explained in [this blog post](http://dev.mikamai.com/post/68453619468/building-web-apps-with-traffic-the-go-micro-framework).

###How it works?
`http://localhost:7000/400` for a 400x400 pixel image  
`http://localhost:7000/400x300` or `http://localhost:7000/400/300` for a 400x300 pixel image    
`<img src="http://localhost:7000/400x300">` to embed the image in your site

Purrraceholder is alive (and slow) on [heroku](http://purrraceholder.herokuapp.com)  
There also a faster copy on [DigitalOcean](http://purrraceholder.pheeco.it)
